            <h2>FTC Robotics – Team 28118 Robostallions</h2>
            <p>I began learning CAD in 8th grade using <strong>Onshape</strong>, diving into the world of 3D modeling and mechanical design. For the 2025 FTC season, I applied these skills to design and build the <strong>drivetrain for our robot</strong> for Team 28118, the Robostallions. This involved planning and assembling the core mechanical systems that allow the robot to move efficiently and reliably on the field.</p>
            <p>During the project, I focused on <strong>precision and efficiency</strong>, making sure every gear, motor, and wheel was optimized for speed, torque, and durability. I collaborated closely with my teammates to integrate the drivetrain with other subsystems, such as the arm mechanism and intake system, ensuring the robot worked seamlessly as a whole.</p>
            <p>I also learned <strong>problem-solving under constraints</strong>, adapting my designs when we faced challenges with weight distribution, space limitations, and motor placement. Using Onshape’s simulation and assembly tools, I was able to test movements virtually before building physical prototypes, saving time and materials.</p>
            <p>This experience strengthened my <strong>CAD and engineering skills</strong>, taught me how to work effectively in a team environment, and gave me practical insight into <strong>robot design, prototyping, and iterative improvement</strong>. Beyond just building the robot, I gained experience in documenting designs, thinking critically about efficiency, and learning the importance of collaboration in STEM projects.</p>
            <p>Overall, this FTC project was my first hands-on experience bringing a <strong>complex mechanical system from concept to reality</strong>, and it solidified my passion for robotics, design, and innovation. I’m excited to continue expanding my portfolio with new projects, pushing the limits of what I can design and create.</p>
